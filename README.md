## Overview

This project analyzes SIMEL (Sistema de Información de Mercado Eléctrico) data files. It was created to process and extract insights from SIMEL data using Scala for data processing and analysis. The analysis covers various aspects such as data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

## Dataset

The project utilizes multiple SIMEL data files, which include detailed records of electrical market information. The dataset files are in a specific format and contain information such as timestamps, market prices, and other relevant data points.

### Files Included:
- `EPFPF_HD_CLE_0770_P2_20230201.14`
- `EPFPF_HD_CLE_0770_P2_20230201.39`
- `EPFPF_HD_CLE_0770_P2_20230202.14`
- (Additional files listed as per the extracted content)

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Processes raw SIMEL data files to remove noise and inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation**: Transforms the data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifies trends and patterns within the data.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs to visualize the data and findings.

## Technologies Used

- **Scala**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Apache Spark**: For handling large-scale data processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
